Enabling dexterous upper limb prostheses to intuitively respond to a user's intention could dramatically improve the lives of millions worldwide. Surface electromyography (EMG) provides access to a user's voluntary neuromuscular drive and can be used to control a prosthesis myoelectrically. However, despite decades of research, most commercially-available devices utilize a simple two-muscle, binary-based controller to actuate a predefined hand posture (i.e., open vs closed). Development of more dexterous multifunctional myoelectric control requires a comprehensive understanding of multi-muscle EMG to infer movement intention. On the other hand, designing a robust myoelectric-controlled upper limb prosthesis for amputees carries its inherent obstacles since most of the patients are not capable of providing robust and reliable signals depending on the limb deficiency level. In this webpage, the supplementary material of the dissertation including publicly available codes, directories to data and visual results are presented.
