  <h2> Force-Sensitive Prosthetic Hand with 3-axis Magnetic Force Sensors</h2>

    
    
  <p>
3-dimensional force sensing in prosthetics is used to incorporate intelligent grasping capabilities, allowing the hand to automatically adjust its grasp or release an object when appropriate. This significantly decreases the burden on the user as well as increase the functionality of the prosthetic. Coupled with an underactuated hand, this opens up possibilities for highly functional, affordable prosthetic hands.  <a href="/projects/imr_pip.html"> <h3> Click here for more information </h3></a>

 <h2>Kinematic Optimization of an Underactuated Anthropomorphic Prosthetic Hand</h2>

    
    
  <p>
The human hand has served as an inspiration for robotic grippers. However, the dimensions of the human hand evolved under a different set of constraints and requirements than that of robots today. This appendices section demonstrates the results of real-time control of an anthropomorphic robotic hand. The hand focuses on maximizing the workspace intersection of the thumb and the other fingers as well as maximizing the size of the largest graspable object. We perform this optimization and use the resulting dimensions to construct a flexible, underactuated 3D printed prototype.
