    <i>
The developed transfer learning scheme for muscle synergies across different tasks suggests that the calibration of a prosthetic. 
In addition, there could be subject-independent muscle synergies for performing constrained and unconstrained tasks and these synergies
are also robust to day-to-day variances. Therefore, a general synergy base which may respond to calibration time obligation of amputees can be obtained
from healthy subjects and only a small time of any unconstrained EMG recording would be sufficient to tune the parameters for daily variances.</i>
