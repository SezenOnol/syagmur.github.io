    <i> We present a method of kinematically optimizing the design of an anthropomorphic robotic hand. We split the optimization into two steps. 
    First, we separately optimize the link lengths of the index, middle, ring, and pinky fingers to most closely match the 2-dimensional workspace of the 
    corresponding human fingers. Next, using these link lengths as a starting point, we perform a 3-dimensional optimization of the entire hand to objectively 
    determine the best positions and orientations of each finger relative to the thumb, as well as the thumb link lengths and joint angles. The hand is optimized
    to maximize the largest object the hand can grasp while also maximizing the workspace intersection of the thumb and other fingers.  </i>
