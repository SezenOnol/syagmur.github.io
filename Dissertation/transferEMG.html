    <i>
    Several machine learning methods, including artificial neural networks (ANN), lineardiscriminant analysis (LDA), support vector machines (SVM),
    and Gaussian mixture models havebeen  previously  used  in  myoelectric-based  motion  control  using  EMG  data,  with  variable  but generally favorable accuracy. 
    To the best of our knowledge, the only methods previously applied specifically to synergy-based gesture classification are SVMs and a variant of ANN’s called 
    Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs). However as noted above, they have only been tested in settings where the low dimensional structure of muscle activations
    was derived from the same dataset that was used for gesture classification. Here we investigate the ability to transfer synergy patterns across three different 
    task domains, as described below.  We compare SVM vs. ELM classifiers for this purpose and report on the sensitivity of ELM to the particular set of random initialization 
    weights.</i>
