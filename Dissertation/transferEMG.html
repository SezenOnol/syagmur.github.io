    <i>Availability of dexterous upper limb prostheses that intuitively respond to a user’s intentionis an ambitious goal that could dramatically improve the
    lives of millions worldwide.  Recording surface electromyography (EMG) provides access to a user’s voluntary neuromuscular drive and can be used to myoelectrically 
    control a powered prostheses. However, despite decades of research, most commercially available devices utilize a simple two muscle, binary-based controller to
    actuate a simple hand posture (i.e., open vs close).  Development of more dexterous multi-functional myoelectric control requires pattern classification of
    multi-muscle EMG to derive movement intent. To this end, evidence that the complexity of human voluntary control may be reduced via identifying multi-muscle 
    patterns with a fixed relative balance of activation that act as "modules", commonly referred to as muscle synergies, has received substantial attention in 
    the myoelectric powered prostheses community.  It has been suggested that accurate capture of these low dimensional control features could offer potential
    advantages over single muscle direct drive, including reduced control complexity,  lower sensitivity to amplitude cancellations,  and greater robustness 
    to slight shifts in electrode position,  as well as offer a richer set of prosthetic movement  options.  Gesture  classification 
    from  EMG  muscle  synergies  has  been  successfully implemented for task-dependent problems.  However, the gap between the synergy assumption
    and practical cross-task implementation remains an open area of investigation. Key to bridging this gap is testing the extent to which synergies transfer across 
    tasks and postures, as well as finding a reliable methodology to classify labeled postures from synergy representations. We address these two open problems using a
    machine learning approach.

    Several machine learning methods, including artificial neural networks (ANN), lineardiscriminant analysis (LDA), support vector machines (SVM),
    and Gaussian mixture models havebeen  previously  used  in  myoelectric-based  motion  control  using  EMG  data,  with  variable  but generally favorable accuracy. 
    To the best of our knowledge, the only methods previously applied specifically to synergy-based gesture classification are SVMs and a variant of ANN’s called 
    Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs). However as noted above, they have only been tested in settings where the low dimensional structure of muscle activations
    was derived from the same dataset that was used for gesture classification. Here we investigate the ability to transfer synergy patterns across three different 
    task domains, as described below.  We compare SVM vs. ELM classifiers for this purpose and report on the sensitivity of ELM to the particular set of random initialization 
    weights.</i>
