  <h2>Force-Sensitive Prosthetic Hand with 3-axis Magnetic Force Sensors </h2>

  <p>
we present a 3D magnetic force sensor embedded in an open-source, affordable advanced prosthetic. Our 3D printable hand, built off Open Bionics' open-source Ada hand, is underactuated to allow for compliant grasping. It additionally is equipped with embedded custom 3-axis force sensors, enabling force control with the hand using shear and normal forces. To capture user intent, we use the Myo Armband to acquire EMG data and employ an Extremely Randomized Tree Classifier to predict the user's grasp type.

    h2>Kinematic Optimization of an Underactuated Anthropomorphic Prosthetic Hand</h2>

<br>
    
  <p>
We demonstrate that the optimized hand outperforms a well-known open-source 3D printed anthropomorphic hand on multiple tasks and test the performance of our hand by employing a classification-based user intent decision system which predicts the grasp type using real-time electromyographic (EMG) activity patterns.
